# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs
   - Port availability (9001, 3000, 4000) for development workflow

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
[Describe the main user journey in plain language]

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate email addresses"]  
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### API Operations Required *(mandatory for all features)*
- **Analysis**: Does this feature need new API operations, or can existing ones be reused?
- **If reusing**: List existing endpoints that will support this feature
- **If extending**: Specify only the new endpoints/schemas that must be added
- **Justification**: Why new operations are needed (if any)

### Port Requirements *(mandatory for development workflow)*
- **Mock Server Port**: Feature requires port 9001 for Specmatic mock server (verify available with `lsof -ti:9001`)
- **Backend Port**: Feature requires port 3000 for Node.js/Express backend server (verify available with `lsof -ti:3000`)
- **Frontend Port**: Feature requires port 4000 for React frontend development (verify available with `lsof -ti:4000`)
- **Port Cleanup**: CRITICAL - User must check and kill any processes on these ports before implementation using `kill -9 PID`

### Technology Stack Requirements *(per constitutional constraints)*
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express framework, in-memory data structures only
- **Frontend**: React application (Create React App or Vite)
- **Testing**: Specmatic MCP contract testing + UI component testing (no manual curl/Postman)
- **Environment**: Use `nvm use stable` for latest stable Node.js version

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

- [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous  
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Scope is clearly bounded
- [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified
- [ ] API operations analysis completed (reuse vs. extend decision made)
- [ ] Only necessary new endpoints specified (if extending)

---
